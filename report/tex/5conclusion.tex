\section{Conclusion}
In this research, our team explored the intuition, implementation, and evaluation of three search strategies for agents in partially-observable (specifically eight-connected) environments. These search strategies were integrated with the Pacman domain, which is a representative application for robot navigation search tasks.
%The metrics for evaluation were the final path length, number of nodes expanded from the search queue, memory use, and runtime.
After evaluating the three search strategies (in addition to A*), the group confirmed that the D* Lite strategy is the optimal re-planning strategy. The D* Lite builds off the theoretical foundation of LPA*, but makes signification optimizations to the implementation that allow it to dominate in terms of performance. The NRA* strategy is competitive in terms of path length, but its simple strategy hurts its performance in all other categories. When a totally observable environment is not practical, D* Lite is the best search strategy of the assessed algorithms.
