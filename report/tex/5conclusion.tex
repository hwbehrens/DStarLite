\section{Conclusion}
In this research, the team explored the intuition, implementation, and evaluation of three search strategies for agents in  partially-observable (specifically eight-connected) environments. These search strategies were integrated with the Pacman domain, which is a representative application for robot navigation search tasks. The metrics for evaluation were the final path length, number of nodes expanded from the search queue, memory use, and runtime. After evaluating the three search strategies (also using A* as a baseline), the group confirmed that the D* Lite strategy is the optimal re-planning strategy. The D* Lite builds off the theoretical foundation of LPA*, but makes signification optimization modifications to the implementation that allow it dominate in terms of performance. The NRA* strategy is competitive in terms of the path length, but its simple strategy hurts its performance in all other categories. When a totally observable environment is not obtainable, D* Lite is the best search strategy to use.
