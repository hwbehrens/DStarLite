\begin{abstract}
Route-finding has historically played an important role within computer science, but often assumes that the region or graph to be traversed is fully known. In practice, this requirement can prove difficult to satisfy; no domain better illustrates this challenge than robotics. As autonomous agents traverse unknown environments, their route-finding must adapt to incorporate new information as it becomes available. In this work, we explore several route-finding algorithms from the literature, including lifelong-planning A*, D* Lite, and naive-replanning A*. We discuss our implementations of these approaches, and assess their strengths, weaknesses, and appropriateness for various scenarios. We conclude by comparing their relative efficacy for autonomous agent pathfinding in partially-observable terrain, as represented by the Pacman pathfinding problem.
